Objects Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with objects in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `objects.boilerplate.ts` and save it as `objects.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/04-objects
cp objects.boilerplate.ts objects.solution.ts
```

to run the test-suite only for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn test src/basics/04-objects
```
