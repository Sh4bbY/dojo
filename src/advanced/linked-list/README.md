Linked List
===========

The goal of this kata is to understand how linked lists are working.
This kata also introduces **generics** and will give you a better understanding of how to work with Objects references.
If you completed this kata you should know the difference between **copy-by-value** and **copy-by-reference**

To run only this particular test-suite, execute:

```bash
yarn jest src/advanced/04-linked-list
```
