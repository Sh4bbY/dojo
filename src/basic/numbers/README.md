Numbers Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with numbers in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `Numbers.template.ts` and save it as `Numbers.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basic/numbers
cp Numbers.template.ts Numbers.solution.ts
```

to run only unit tests for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn jest src/basic/numbers
```
