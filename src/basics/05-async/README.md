Async Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with async in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `Async.template.ts` and save it as `Async.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/05-async
cp Async.template.ts Async.solution.ts
```

to run only unit tests for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn jest src/basics/05-async
```
