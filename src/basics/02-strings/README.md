Strings Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with strings in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `strings.boilerplate.ts` and save it as `strings.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/02-strings
cp strings.boilerplate.ts strings.solution.ts
```

to run the test-suite only for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn test src/basics/02-strings
```
