Arrays Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with arrays in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `arrays.boilerplate.ts` and save it as `arrays.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/03-arrays
cp arrays.boilerplate.ts arrays.solution.ts
```

to run only unit tests for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn jest src/basics/03-arrays
```
