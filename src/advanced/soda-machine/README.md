Soda Machine
============

The goal of this kata is to implement a Soda-Machine.
A user should be able to insert coins, select a drink, and get overpaid cash back.
The machine should also keep track of its stock. so that a User cannot select a drink, that is already sold out.
And of course the machine needs to keep track of its coins.

To run only this particular test-suite, execute:

```bash
yarn jest src/advanced/soda-machine
```
