Rover Mission - 02 - Loot Minerals
==================================

`Protocol02.ts` is should be used to control the deployed rover and fulfill the mission.
Since you completed mission 01, you should have some additional features added to your rover.
To make use of those features you'll probably want to let `Rover02` extend from `Rover01`.
This way, Rover02 has automatically built-in all features that Rover01 had.

The Goal of this Mission:
- Collect all Minerals
