Strings Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with strings in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `Strings.template.ts` and save it as `Strings.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/02-strings
cp Strings.template.ts Strings.solution.ts
```

to run only unit tests for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn jest src/basics/02-strings
```
