Objects Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with objects in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `Objects.template.ts` and save it as `Objects.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/04-objects
cp Objects.template.ts Objects.solution.ts
```

to run only unit tests for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn jest src/basics/04-objects
```
