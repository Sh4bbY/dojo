Numbers Kata
============

Here you learn how to work with numbers in javascript/typescript.

To get started make a copy of `numbers.boilerplate.ts` and save it as `numbers.solution.ts`

```bash
cd src/basics/01-numbers
cp numbers.boilerplate.ts numbers.solution.ts
```

to run the test-suite only for that particular kata, you can execute
```bash
yarn test src/basics/01-numbers
```
