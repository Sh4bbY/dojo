Linked List
===========

The goal of this kata is to understand how linked lists are working.
This kata also introduces **generics** and will give you a better understanding of how to work with Objects references.
If you completed this kata you should know the difference between **copy-by-value** and **copy-by-reference**

To start this kata, you should navigate into this directory and make a solution copy of `LinkedList.ts`

```bash
cp src/advanced/04-linked-list/LinkedList.ts src/advanced/04-linked-list/LinkedList.solution.ts
yarn jest src/advanced/04-linked-list
```
